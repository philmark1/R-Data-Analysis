# R-Data-Analysis

Data Analysis projects that I did for Uni (course: Data Analytics):

Project 1.:
- Task was a descriptive Analysis of U.S. College Data from Iowa.
- After preprocessing, I programmed a linear regresison model (both a basic one and one with feature engineering/split per college typ)
- I then did a stepwise variable selection based on AIC.
- Lastly, I split into training & test data-set, normalized the data & applied a knn (K-nearest-neighbor) regression

(I attached the .rmd file, which can be downloaded to replicate the code in RStudio. The data is automatically downloaded from an online repository from the Data Science department (included an excel file as an extra tough, should the file be removed sometime).)

Project 2:
- The aim of the project was to analyse the customer turnover or churn of a telecommunications company.
- After an exploratory analysis, I did a basic logistic regression with all variable and did a step-wise variable selection for an optimized model
- I then compared both model's churn probability, accuracy, recall, precision & F1 scores
- Lastly, as a bonus, I also tried to improve the model via a cutoff point selection

Project 3:
- This was a continuation of project 2 with different types of models employed.
- Build a classification tree on the training sample (optimally pruned)
- From this tree chose variables for the split
- Compared the logistic regression, classification tree and random forest models on accuracy, recall and precision (on the test sample)
