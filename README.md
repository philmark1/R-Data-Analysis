# R-Data-Analysis

Data Analysis projects that I did for Uni (course: Data Analytics):

Project 1.:
- Task was a descriptive Analysis of U.S. College Data from Iowa.
- After preprocessing, I programmed a linear regresison model (both a basic one and one with feature engineering/split per college typ)
- I then did a stepwise variable selection based on AIC.
- Lastly, I split into training & test data-set, normalized the data & applied a knn (K-nearest-neighbor) regression

(I attached the .rmd file, which can be downloaded to replicate the code in RStudio. The data is automatically downloaded from an online repository from the Data Science department (included an excel file as an extra tough, should the file be removed sometime).)
